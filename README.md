# Advanced User Interfaces Using Collection View

This example demonstrates code factoring approaches to UICollectionViewDataSource that allow developers to compose complex and rich data models. In addition, the sample implements swipe to edit, batch editing including drag reordering, and a sophisticated custom UICollectionViewLayout that features pinning headers, global headers, and loading placeholders.

# Changelog
## 1.1.11
Support for pinned footers. As opposed topinned headers, pinned footers stick to the bottom of the screen if they would otherwise be hidden below the viewport.
 
## 1.1.10
Better support for empty/error views with button actions.
